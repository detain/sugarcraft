# prompt_resume.md — the entry point for the prompt-architecture plan

> **This file has two jobs, and which one it is doing depends on when you read it.**
>
> 1. **Before the plan starts** (its current state) it is a **start prompt**: hand this file to a
>    fresh agent with no prior conversation and the plan begins correctly.
> 2. **After the plan starts** it is **rewritten after every step** so that it becomes a **resume
>    prompt**: hand it to a fresh agent and the plan picks up from wherever it actually is and runs
>    to the end.
>
> The rewrite instructions are in §R at the bottom. They are part of the file on purpose — whoever
> rewrites it is reading it.

**Current state: Phase 1 CLOSED — all 7 steps (P1.S1–S7) merged; Phase 2 batch 1 (P2.S1 + P2.S3, concurrent) is next.**

---

## 1. Who you are and what you are doing

You are the **orchestrator** for the sugar-crush prompt-architecture plan, running in
`/home/sites/sugarcraft` on branch `master`.

You do not write production code. You spawn agents, verify their work against test output you run
yourself, merge it, commit it, and maintain two bookkeeping files. Everything that touches
`sugar-crush/src/` or `sugar-crush/tests/` goes through a spawned step agent, every time, including
changes that feel too small to be worth spawning for.

## 2. Read these first, in this order

1. **`/home/sites/sugarcraft/prompt_plan.md`** — your complete operating manual. Read it in full
   before doing anything else. §1 is the execution contract, §2 is concurrency, §3 is bookkeeping,
   §4 onward are the phases, §16 is the lessons every agent you spawn must be given, §17 is the
   invariants, §18 is what not to build. Inside §1, **§1.10 (removal is not an available outcome)**
   and **§1.11 (what counts as a test)** go to every agent you spawn, alongside §16 and §17.
2. **`/home/sites/sugarcraft/prompt_worklog.md`** — the record. It holds the conventions, the
   required entry format, one worked example, and every step entry so far. Read the format; you will
   be writing in it after every step.
3. **`/home/sites/sugarcraft/prompt_expand.md`** — the 4,063-line research dossier the plan
   executes. Do **not** read it end to end now. Each step names the sections its agent must read;
   read those sections when you brief that agent, and read §0 and §1 now so you understand the lead
   finding.
4. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` — repo conventions.

## 3. Why the order matters — the lead finding

`sugar-crush` assembles a seven-layer system prompt in `Runtime::buildSystemPrompt()`
(`sugar-crush/src/Runtime.php:1673`) and then discards it. `SglangProvider` — the default provider —
and `CustomProvider` never read `CompleteRequest::$systemPrompt`; `OpenAIProvider` reads it in
`complete()` and drops it in `completeStream()`, which is the path an interactive turn uses.

The agent therefore has no identity, no working directory, no git state, no date, no project
instructions, no memory, and no skill listing. It functions only because the channels that ride on
tool results and message history still work.

**Nothing else in this plan is observable until Phase 1 lands.** Do not reorder the phases to get to
the interesting content first.

## 4. How to resume (replaces "Your first actions" once the plan has started)

1. Confirm you are in `/home/sites/sugarcraft` on `master` with a clean tree
   (`git status --porcelain` — nothing should be dirty; untracked files outside the plan's own
   bookkeeping are possible, inspect before trusting).
2. Confirm the last step entry in `prompt_worklog.md` (under `## ENTRIES`, newest first) matches the
   plan's last commit in `git log`. If it does not — a step is missing its entry, or an entry has no
   commit — **reconstruct the missing entry before doing anything else** (`prompt_plan.md` §3.3).
   Note: a step's bookkeeping commit (this file + the worklog entry) can sit on top of the step's
   own commit; both belong to the same step. P0.S1's step commit is `19533373e`; its bookkeeping
   commit carries the worklog entry and this resume.
3. Confirm the commit identity (silent failure otherwise):
   ```sh
   git -C /home/sites/sugarcraft config user.name    # must print: Joe Huss
   git -C /home/sites/sugarcraft config user.email   # must print: detain@interserver.net
   ```
4. **Audit for stale worktrees before you spawn anything.** `git -C /home/sites/sugarcraft worktree
   list`. For every `/home/sites/prompt-step-<ID>` listed, run the status/log checks of
   `prompt_plan.md` §1.12. **A worktree listed here that is not a step you spawned in this session
   is stale by definition.** `/home/sites/crush-lane-{a,b,c}` will also appear if they are
   worktrees — they belong to the other plan. Leave them completely alone.
5. Confirm you will not modify `docs/plans/crush_code_*.md` or `left_steps.md`. They are read-only to
   you, in both directions: you take knowledge out, you put nothing in.
6. Then read §8 below and do exactly what `Next step` says.

## 5. The sequencing gate — checked

**CHECKED 2026-08-26 — decision: proceed.** Phases 0–4 are safe to run alongside the other plan
(`docs/plans/crush_code_*.md`): they add no new files under `sugar-crush/src/` and touch no
lane-owned files except `Chat.php`/`ContextCompactor.php` in Phase 4. **Do not start Phase 5 or
Phase 6 while the other plan has a round in flight** — they add most of the ~11 new `src/` files and
will fight the file-count census. Re-check before Phase 5 by asking the supervisor rather than
reading the lane worktrees.

Collisions still live (re-check before the named phases):

| Collision | Detail |
|---|---|
| `sugar-crush/tests/Tools/BuiltInToolCorpusTest.php` + `sugar-crush/src/Context/RepoMapBlock.php` | The census asserts exact `src/` cardinalities — `assertSame(297, $files)`, `assertSame(316, $declarations)` — **and** asserts that `RepoMapBlock.php`'s doc-block (line 273, *"`src/` here is 297 files"*) restates two of them. Adding one file to `src/` reds four assertions across two files, one of them production source. This plan adds **~11** files under `sugar-crush/src/`. **Hardest collision; unavoidable. Phases 5+.** |
| `sugar-crush/src/Backend/EngineBackend.php` | Held by an in-flight lane; wanted by this plan's P7.S3. |
| `sugar-crush/src/Chat.php` + `sugar-crush/src/Context/ContextCompactor.php` | The other plan carries a long-standing, untouched backlog of context-window / compaction / spend-cap findings in exactly these two files. This plan's Phases 4 and 8 rewrite them. |
| `sugar-crush/src/Tools/BuiltIn/Bash.php` | The other plan has two open items rewriting its **behaviour**; this plan's P9.S3 rewrites its **description**. |
| `sugar-crush/src/Agents/AgentDefinition.php` | The other plan's `C7` — `$defaultTools` is inert — gates what this plan's P7.S5 preset prompts are allowed to claim. |
| `sugar-crush/tests/Support/` (whole directory) | Assigned wholesale to an in-flight lane. This plan's P2.S4 wants `PromptFixture.php` there; P2.S4 carries the workaround. |
| `sugar-crush/tests/` tree-wide census tests | `SymbolCitationDriftTest`, `SwallowingCatchCensusTest`, `DuplicatedTestHelperDriftTest`, `ChildWallClockBudgetTest`, `EnvRosterDriftTest` and others walk the whole tree. **Every test file this plan adds can red one of them.** Several are owned by in-flight lanes. |

## 6. The loop you run, in short

Full detail in `prompt_plan.md` §1. The short form:

- Pick the next phase's next batch. Five steps at a time, chosen so their declared file lists are
  **disjoint**. Fewer when the phase does not offer five.
- One git worktree per step, branched from current `master`:
  `git -C /home/sites/sugarcraft worktree add /home/sites/prompt-step-<STEP_ID> -b prompt/<STEP_ID> master`
- **Then give that worktree a `vendor/`, or nothing in it can run a test.** `sugar-crush/vendor/` is
  gitignored, so a fresh worktree has no autoloader and no `vendor/bin/phpunit`, and agents may not
  run `composer install`. Hard-link it in and verify it points at the **worktree**:
  ```sh
  cp -al /home/sites/sugarcraft/sugar-crush/vendor \
         /home/sites/prompt-step-<STEP_ID>/sugar-crush/vendor
  cd /home/sites/prompt-step-<STEP_ID>/sugar-crush && php -r '
    $p = require "vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php";
    echo $p["SugarCraft\\Crush\\"][0], PHP_EOL;'
  ```
  That must print `/home/sites/prompt-step-<STEP_ID>/sugar-crush/src`. **Do not use `ln -s`** — a
  symlinked `vendor/` makes the autoloader resolve to the **main repo's** `src/`, so the agent's own
  edits never load and every test result is about the wrong code. Full detail and the measurements:
  `prompt_plan.md` §1.2 action 2.
- Spawn the step agent with the step text, its file list, the `prompt_expand.md` sections it names,
  and `prompt_plan.md` §1.10, §1.11, §16 and §17.
- The step agent implements **and updates the tests**, then spawns a review agent (brief in
  `prompt_plan.md` §1.4). Findings → fix agent → **a brand-new** review agent → loop. Break only on a
  clean review. Cap five cycles, then the step is blocked.
- **If any agent comes back empty, aborted, or truncated: it died — it did not "have nothing to
  say".** A blank reviewer is not `NO FINDINGS`; a blank step agent has not finished the step. Work
  the ladder in `prompt_plan.md` §1.8: resume the same agent if you can, otherwise read its worktree
  (§1.8.4) to find out how far it got, then relaunch a new agent **in that same worktree** with a
  continuation brief telling it what is already there and not to start over. Blank returns get five
  attempts, not three. Never write the missing report yourself.
- You run the tests yourself and record **your** numbers.
- Merge each step back into `master` in the main repo dir, one at a time, with a test run between
  merges. Commit directly to `master` with the detailed message format in §1.6. **Do not push.**
- Remove the worktree.
- **Append the worklog entry and rewrite this file.** The step is not complete until you have.
- Between batches, spawn a sync agent to bring every live worktree up to current `master`.
- At the end of each phase, spawn a phase review agent over all that phase's commits together.
  Findings → fix → **a new** phase reviewer → loop. Cap three cycles.

## 7. Non-negotiables

- Never modify `docs/plans/crush_code_*.md` or `left_steps.md`.
- Never touch `/home/sites/crush-lane-{a,b,c}`.
- Never `git push`, unless a push is genuinely required to complete a merge. If you think it is,
  stop and ask.
- Never run `caliber`. Never suppress a git hook (`--no-verify`, `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`).
- Never run a global `pkill`.
- Never run `composer install`/`composer update` without deciding to for a named reason — it
  de-symlinks `vendor/sugarcraft/*` and silently voids every measurement taken after it.
- Never weaken, skip, rename-out, or delete an existing test to make a change pass.
- **Never remove unfinished, dormant, unwired, or unreachable code — yours or anyone's.** Removal is
  not an outcome available to you or to any agent you spawn. The three permitted outcomes are: wire
  it, build it out, or **stop and ask the user**. This covers the quiet forms too — stubbing the
  body, dropping the last call site, deleting the enum case / parameter / config key that kept it
  alive, `@deprecated`-ing it aside, or deleting the test that pinned its dormancy. If an agent's
  diff removes one of these, reject it and re-spawn. Full rule: `prompt_plan.md` §1.10.
  **Escalating is a completed step, not a failed one** — record it in the worklog and in §8 below
  under `Awaiting user decision:`, verbatim, with `file:line`, what calls it (or that nothing does),
  and the options. Then wait for the user; do not decide it yourself.
- **Never accept an annotation or an existence check as a test.** `@covers`, `@test`, a descriptive
  method name, `method_exists()`, `class_exists()`, `is_callable()` and shape assertions
  (`assertNotNull`, `assertIsArray`, `assertTrue(count(...) > 0)`) all pass on wrong or absent
  behaviour. A real test calls the thing and asserts the value, asserts exact counts, covers both
  polarities and the pathological input — and goes **red when the change is reverted**. Require the
  step agent to state the deletion experiment it ran and what it showed. Full rule:
  `prompt_plan.md` §1.11 and §16.2.
- Never accept an agent's claim of completion without test output you ran yourself.
- **Never read an empty or aborted agent response as a result.** It means the agent died. Recover it
  (`prompt_plan.md` §1.8) — do not accept it, do not fill in what it would have said, and do not
  merge its worktree because the tests happen to be green.
- Never commit before confirming `user.name` / `user.email` are `Joe Huss` /
  `detain@interserver.net` (§4). A wrong author is silent and cannot be fixed afterwards
  without rewriting history.
- Never `ln -s` a worktree's `vendor/`. Use `cp -al` and verify the PSR-4 root (§6). A symlinked
  `vendor/` silently runs every test against the main repo's `src/`.
- Never delete a worktree without first checking it for uncommitted changes and unmerged commits
  (`prompt_plan.md` §1.12).
- Never write a worklog number you did not measure.
- Use `/usr/bin/grep` for anything that must see the whole tree — the shell's `grep` is `ugrep` and
  its recursive scans honour `.gitignore`.

## §R. How to rewrite this file (read this before every rewrite)

**Rewrite this file after every single step, and after every phase close.** Not append — **replace**.
This file always describes the *current* state and the *next* action. History belongs in
`prompt_worklog.md`; if you find yourself adding a "previously…" section here, that content belongs
there instead.

### What must survive every rewrite, unchanged in substance

Sections **1, 2, 6, 7** and this section **§R**. They are the operating instructions and they do not
change as the plan progresses. Copy them forward verbatim. If you find an error in them, fix it and
say so in the worklog entry for the step that fixed it.

### What you replace every time

- **The banner** at the top: change `Current state: NOT STARTED` to a one-line statement of where the
  plan is (e.g. `Current state: Phase 4, step P4.S3 in flight; phases 0–3 closed`).
- **§3** — once Phase 1 has landed, replace the lead-finding explanation with a short "what has been
  built so far" summary: the three or four things a fresh agent needs to know about the *current*
  shape of the code, not the original defect. Keep it under fifteen lines. When it grows past that,
  you are writing history; move it to the worklog.
- **§4 (Your first actions)** — becomes "how to resume": confirm the tree is clean, confirm the last
  step in `prompt_worklog.md` matches the last commit in `git log`, and if it does not, **reconstruct
  the missing entry before doing anything else** (`prompt_plan.md` §3.3).
- **§5 (the sequencing gate)** — once the gate has been checked and cleared, replace it with a
  one-line record of the decision and the date, plus any collision that is still live. If a
  collision is still live, keep the row that describes it.
- **§8 (Where you are right now)** — always rewritten. Every field, every time.

### The §8 block's required fields

```
Phase:            <current phase id and title, or "between phases">
Next step:        <STEP_ID> — <one-line goal>
Steps done:       <N> of 61
Phases done:      <N> of 12
Last commit:      <sha> — <subject line>
Baseline:         Tests: <N>, Assertions: <N>, Skipped: <N>  (from P0.S1, never edited)
Latest suite:     Tests: <N>, Assertions: <N>, Skipped: <N>  (from your last verification run)
In-flight batch:  <the batch id, its steps, their worktree paths, and the declared MERGE ORDER —
                  or "none". Write it the moment you spawn a batch, not when you start merging.>
Live worktrees:   <paths, or "none". Each one: the step it belongs to, and whether that step is
                  in flight, parked (§1.2 action 6), or stale (§1.12).>
Blocked on:       <nothing | STEP_ID and the standing findings, verbatim>
Awaiting user decision: <nothing | STEP_ID, the file:line, and the question, verbatim — the
                  dormant-code escalations from prompt_plan.md §1.10 that no agent may resolve>
Open follow-ups:  <the follow-ups recorded in worklog entries that are not yet scheduled>
Sequencing gate:  <CHECKED YYYY-MM-DD — decision | UNCHECKED>
```

`Baseline` is written once, at P0.S1, and never edited afterwards. It is the number every later delta
is measured against, and a moving baseline makes every delta meaningless.

### Rules for the rewrite

- **`In-flight batch` is the field that survives a session loss.** Every other field describes work
  that is already *finished* and therefore already recoverable from `git log` and the worklog. Five
  agents running in five worktrees with a merge order you decided in your head is recoverable from
  nothing. Write it at spawn time. Clear it at batch close, not before.
- **A fresh agent handed only this file must be able to continue.** After writing it, reread it as if
  you had never seen this repository. If a sentence assumes something you learned in conversation,
  rewrite the sentence.
- **Never write a "Next step" you have not confirmed against `prompt_plan.md`.** Look it up; do not
  recall it.
- **Never carry a stale number forward.** If you did not run the suite this step, say
  `Latest suite: not re-run this step (last measured at <STEP_ID>)` rather than repeating an old
  figure as if it were current.
- **If a step is blocked, the blocking findings go in §8 verbatim**, not summarised. The next agent
  needs the actual text to act on it.
- **A dormant-code escalation is never resolved by a rewrite.** It leaves `Awaiting user decision:`
  only when the user has answered, and the answer goes into the worklog entry for the step that acts
  on it. Carrying it forward unanswered, every rewrite, is correct.
- **If you are about to be cut off** (context limit, session limit), rewriting this file is the last
  thing you do and the highest-value thing you can do. Do it before anything else you were planning
  to finish.
