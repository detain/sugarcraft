# crush_code.md execution worklog

Resumable state for the `crush_code.md` audit remediation. `crush_code.md` (repo
root, committed `418c0888`) is the authority: lines 1-203 are the Executive
Summary + Implementation Plan, 209-2160 are the 13 research dossiers.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-13, after P1.1 committed (`15de96a5`).

## The loop (per step, one at a time — never in parallel)

1. Spawn an agent to implement the step.
2. Spawn a **separate** agent to adversarially review the diff.
3. Findings → spawn a fix agent → **go back to 2**.
4. No findings → run the full suite → **commit directly to master** → next step.

Cap ~2 review rounds per step unless a blocker is still open. Scale reviewer
depth to risk: light for mechanical steps (docs, renames, env tables), deep
adversarial for wiring-heavy ones (P1.1, P1.2, the P2 wiring, P3.1 TextInput).
Good reviewers demonstrate findings with runnable repros; returning CLEAN is an
acceptable outcome. Build tests out as you go.

## Standing rules

- **Never delete a feature because it looks incomplete or dead** — complete it,
  wire it, or document it as an intentional dormant seam. The audit contains
  several "delete this" recommendations from its own research agents that were
  explicitly overridden for this reason. Move/consolidate is fine; removal is not.
- Commit directly to `master`. No branches, no PRs. Author
  `Joe Huss <detain@interserver.net>`, trailer
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- **Do not run `caliber` anything.** A stop hook nags every turn; that is
  expected and pre-authorized to ignore. There is no pre-commit hook installed.
- Separate commits per distinct concern where the seams allow it; lump only when
  they genuinely do not. Split a mixed file by hunk (`git apply --cached`) rather
  than lumping.
- Conventions: `declare(strict_types=1);` first line, PSR-12, PHP 8.3+, `final`
  unless extension is the contract, immutable+fluent `with*()` via `mutate()`,
  bare accessors (no `get`), `::new()` factories, comment WHY not WHAT.
- Never add a blanket total-request timeout to a provider HTTP client — LLM
  completions can legitimately run tens of minutes. Short `connect_timeout` only.
- Stale per-lib `vendor/`/`composer.lock` cause false local failures —
  `composer update` in that lib before believing one.
- Bash cwd does NOT persist between calls — anchor absolute paths or chain.
- Run sub-agents **one at a time**; concurrent writes collide.

## Do not touch

- `McpClientTest::testLoadConfigReturnsEmptyArrayWhenFileGetContentsFails` — the
  1 legitimate skip.
- `docs/plans/plans_cleaning.md` — untracked, unrelated pre-existing work.
- The lib is not `php-cs-fixer`-clean repo-wide (999 files dirty at baseline);
  do not normalize unrelated files.

## Verification baseline

- Full suite: `cd /home/sites/sugarcraft/sugar-crush && vendor/bin/phpunit`
- **Current: 5196 tests / 16091 assertions / 1 skipped / 0 failures**, ~2:22.
- Test-count arithmetic: `BinSugarcrushWiringTest::crushSourceFiles()` is a
  `@dataProvider` scanning all of `src/`, so **each new `src/` file adds exactly
  1 test**. Account for it when reconciling deltas.
- `phpunit.xml` has `failOnWarning="true"`; `tests/bootstrap.php` sandboxes the
  IPC sweep, exports `TMPDIR`, and pins the event loop (see below).

(Step 5 folded into step 1. **Phase 0 is complete.**)

## In flight

- **#52 + #53** — test-hygiene leaks. Agent running. Two independent
  change-sets, to be committed separately.

## Queue

1. **#55 — extract fork/collect/reap into candy-core** (user-confirmed, promoted
   to near-term). See below.
2. **#11 — P1.2** unify permissions; `ScriptHook` ask/modify. Depends on P1.1.
3. #54 AgentWorkerPool `executeAll()` hang — check against #55 first, it may be
   fixed or made moot rather than needing its own fix.
4. #12-#17 P2 wiring · #18-#21 P3 sibling-lib reuse · #22-#26 P4 commands/CLI ·
   #27-#30 P5 context/cost/prompt · #31-#33 P6 settings · #34-#36 P7 docs ·
   #37-#46 P8 polish · #47 P2.9 plugin manifest epic.
5. Follow-ups: #48, #49 (fixed in P1.1 — verify and close), #50, #51, #56.

Dependencies: #11→#10 ✅ · #15 wants #11's exit codes · #29 after #11 ·
#33 after #11+#31 · #39/#40/#45 need P1.1's live-output accessor ✅ ·
#47 after #12-#17.

## Findings worth not losing

### The ExtUvLoop stale-clock trap (`19fb6232`, task #56)

`Loop::get()` returns `ExtUvLoop` where ext-uv is installed. libuv computes a
timer's deadline against the loop's **cached** clock, refreshed only inside
`uv_run()`. PHPUnit runs the loop in short bursts with long synchronous stretches
between, so a timer armed for 10s against a 10s-stale clock is already overdue
and fires on the **first tick** — `run()` returns immediately and the test fails
having consumed no wall time. Effective delay = `delay - idle_since_last_run`
(8s idle → 2.0013s; 10.5s → 0.0002s).

Caused a **33% failure rate** (2-in-6, on baseline as well) in
`BinSugarcrushWiringTest`, `StreamingWiringTest`, `SystemPromptWiringTest`.
An earlier diagnosis blaming a stale `$loop->stop()` handler was **wrong**;
instrumenting `ExtUvLoop::run()/stop()` predicted 12 of 12 runs from the idle gap.
Fixed by pinning `StreamSelectLoop` in `tests/bootstrap.php`. 8/8 green after,
at no time cost. Production is immune because `Program::run()` drives one
continuous `uv_run()`.

**Other libs are plausibly flaking for this reason** — candy-query, candy-wish,
candy-pty, candy-mosaic. Signature: intermittent failure consuming no wall time.

### Why P1.1's `AgentManager` is "live" but sub-agents do not run

Nothing in `src/`/`bin/` calls `createSubAgent()`/`executeSubAgent()`, there is
no Task tool, and `WorkflowEngine` is never constructed. So `/agents`, `/agent`
and Ctrl+A work, but the agent strip and dashboard rows are **reachable and not
yet populatable**. That is P8.13 (#45) and P2.3 (#13), not a P1.1 defect.

### Carried into #11 (P1.2)

`AgentManager::evaluateToolCalls()` turns `PermissionDecision::Ask` into a hard
`RuntimeException`, so `PermissionMode::Auto`'s 3-strike escalation-to-Ask is a
dead end for sub-agents. Verified byte-identical to baseline — pre-existing, not
introduced by P1.1. `PermissionGate` is now reachable for the first time.

### Design overrides made on the user's behalf (both stated at the time)

- Session retention made **opt-in** (default `0`): a destructive opt-out default
  resting on a signal that fires at most once and fails silently is not defensible.
- "No prompt given" moved from exit 1 to exit **2** (pre-1.0, no tagged release).

### Deliberately dormant, documented, not deleted

- `AgentWorkerPool::waitForCompletion()`'s blocking `usleep()` and
  `AgentPoolConfig::$maxRetries` — `Chat::executeAgents()` has zero callers, so
  nothing reachable drives them. Re-verify before assuming still true.
- `AgentManager::liveOutputs()` — awaiting P8.4's split-pane compositor.

### #55 scope (user-confirmed: candy-core, consolidate broadly)

Seven hand-rolled `pcntl_fork` sites in sugar-crush (`Chat`, `Runtime`,
`EngineBackend`, `WorkflowEngine`, `AgentWorkerPool`, `BackgroundSessionRunner`,
`BackgroundSupervisor`, plus `Support/ForkedChild`). Bugs found in three — the
same class each time.

candy-core, **not** candy-async: candy-async requires candy-core and sugar-crush
does not depend on it; candy-core already owns `WorkerPool`,
`Util/Tty/PosixBackend` (forks) and `Program.php`; candy-async is
cooperative/promise/loop-resident and this primitive runs where there is **no
loop**.

A **sibling** of `WorkerPool`, not a replacement — `WorkerPool` is `proc_open` +
serialized closures + loop-driven and needs a running loop. Name them so the
loop-driven vs loop-free split is obvious at the call site.

Moves up: the "never `waitpid(-1)`" pid-ownership invariant (process-global,
today enforced only by comment); fork/collect/reap with deadline + SIGKILL +
bounded reap + orphan policy; IPC payload files (`Support/ToolIpcFiles` — 0600
via umask narrowed around the create, atomic `.partial`+rename, lstat-based
age sweep); the "a forked child must not inherit the parent's loop" contract +
detach helper; fd hygiene/CLOEXEC (inherited socketpair delays parent EOF by a
measured 3.21s).

Stays in sugar-crush: `Tools\ParallelSafe` segmentation policy, permission
gating order, `CarriesSessionState` announce-once merge.

Approach: survey the seven call sites first so the API is derived from them;
build in candy-core with tests; convert sugar-crush to thin adapters one at a
time with the suite green between each; deep adversarial review because 52 libs
sit on candy-core. Design goal — **the safe path must be the easy path**, or the
eighth call site hand-rolls too.
